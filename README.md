# üçéü•ï Fruits and Vegetables

## üéØ Goal
We want to build a service which will take a `request.json` and:
* Process the file and create two separate collections for `Fruits` and `Vegetables`
* Each collection has methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `list()`;
* Units have to be stored as grams;
* Store the collections in a storage engine of your choice. (e.g. Database, In-memory)
* Provide an API endpoint to query the collections. As a bonus, this endpoint can accept filters to be applied to the returning collection.
* Provide another API endpoint to add new items to the collections (i.e., your storage engine).
* As a bonus you might:
  * consider giving an option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
  * how to implement `search()` method collections;
  * use latest version of Symfony's to embed your logic 

### ‚úîÔ∏è How can I check if my code is working?
You have two ways of moving on:
* You call the Service from PHPUnit test like it's done in dummy test (just run `bin/phpunit` from the console)

or

* You create a Controller which will be calling the service with a json payload

## üí° Hints before you start working on it
* Keep KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID principles in mind
* We value a clean domain model, without unnecessary code duplication or complexity
* Think about how you will handle input validation
* Follow generally-accepted good practices, such as no logic in controllers, information hiding (see the first hint).
* Timebox your work - we expect that you would spend between 3 and 4 hours.
* Your code should be tested
* We don't care how you handle data persistence, no bonus points for having a complex method


### üõ†Ô∏è Using the Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify common development tasks. Here are some useful commands (Note: it uses Docker , Docker compose):

- **Start Environment:**
  ```sh
  make start
  ```

- **Run tests:**
  ```sh
  make test
  ```
